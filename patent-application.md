## SYSTEM AND METHOD FOR QUANTUM-RESISTANT INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY TOKENIZATION AND TRADING PLATFORM

### FIELD OF THE INVENTION

The present invention relates to blockchain-based intellectual property management systems, and more specifically to a quantum-resistant platform for tokenizing, trading, and managing intellectual property assets using advanced cryptographic methods and decentralized governance protocols.

### BACKGROUND OF THE INVENTION

The global intellectual property market represents approximately $6.6 trillion in value, yet current IP management systems suffer from several critical limitations:

1. **Security Vulnerabilities**: Traditional cryptographic methods are vulnerable to quantum computing attacks, threatening the $2.1 trillion in IP assets at risk.

2. **Liquidity Constraints**: IP assets are typically illiquid, with limited mechanisms for fractional ownership or trading.

3. **Valuation Challenges**: No standardized, real-time valuation methods exist for IP assets.

4. **Access Barriers**: High barriers to entry prevent smaller investors from participating in IP markets.

5. **Transparency Issues**: Lack of transparent, auditable systems for IP ownership and transaction history.

Prior art includes basic blockchain implementations for digital assets, but none address the specific requirements of intellectual property tokenization with quantum-resistant security and real-time market dynamics.

### SUMMARY OF THE INVENTION

The present invention provides a comprehensive system and method for quantum-resistant intellectual property tokenization comprising:

**Primary Innovation Areas:**

1. **Quantum-Resistant IP Tokenization Protocol (IPT-1155)**
