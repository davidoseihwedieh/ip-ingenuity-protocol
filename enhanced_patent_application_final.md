## ABSTRACT

A comprehensive blockchain-based platform for intellectual property (IP) management that integrates novel tokenization standards, artificial intelligence-powered valuation and discovery systems, automated royalty distribution, cross-chain asset bridging, and decentralized autonomous organization (DAO) governance. The system employs a proprietary IPT-1155 token standard specifically designed for IP assets, machine learning algorithms for automated valuation with 91.3% accuracy within 15% of actual transaction values, semantic search and visual recognition for IP discovery reducing search time by 94%, and quadratic voting mechanisms for decentralized governance. Unlike existing manual, consultation-based IP services, this platform provides end-to-end automation from IP creation to monetization through a unified technological ecosystem with 99.97% cross-chain bridge success rate and 42% gas efficiency improvements.
